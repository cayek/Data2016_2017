Some scripts to convert the .csv files into different formats:
- scriptBayenv.R : to convert the CSV into a BayEnv format
- scriptBayenv_env.R : to extract and standardise environment information from the CSV files, as well as simulate a new "fake" environment
- scriptBayescan.R : to convert the CSV into a Bayescan format (this script is less user-friendly than the above, but it is well documented nonetheless)
- BFtoqval.R : Script to convert Bayes Factors into q-values (poorly documented, but short and hopefully straightforward)
- functions.R : some usefull functions to compute power, FDR, and so on (probably useless, but here anyway)

BONUS: description of the CSV file
- first column: pop ID
- second column: environmental value
- all the rest: genotypes.
Because individuals are diploid, each locus is represented by two consecutive columns 
(one for each copy, i.e. loc1.1, loc1.2, loc2.1, loc 2.2, loc3.1, loc3.2...)
